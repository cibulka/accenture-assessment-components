## What is this?

This repository serves as a proof of concept for a design system that aims to streamline development and ensure consistency across various front-end platforms. As part of an interview assessment, this system demonstrates a potential approach to expanding and innovating an existing design system to accommodate multiple devices. While this is a starting point, it highlights the feasibility of creating a centralized hub for reusable components and guidelines.

## Features

- **NPM Package**: The design system is packaged as an NPM module for easy integration into projects.
- **Storybook**: A development environment for visualizing and interacting with components in isolation, facilitating testing and documentation.
- **Unit Tests**: Automated tests verify the correctness and functionality of components, ensuring quality and reliability.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The design system is designed to adapt seamlessly to different platforms, including mobile, desktop, in-car HMI, smart home devices, and wearables.

## Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Reduces development time by providing pre-built components.
- **Consistency**: Maintains a unified look and feel across all platforms.
- **Usability**: Ensures a consistent user experience.
- **Innovation**: Supports the creation of innovative and engaging interfaces.

## How to use

### Integrate to project

```
import {¬†Button } from 'accenture-assessment-components';
